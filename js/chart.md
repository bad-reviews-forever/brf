## Brief

The chart.js file includes three functions to add and render complaints on the chart.
The `addComplaint()` function is called when a new complaint is submitted through the form, adding the complaint to the chart and updating the count for existing complaints.
The `loadBadReviews()` function loads existing complaint data from local storage and renders it on the chart.
The `renderComplaints()` function renders the list of complaints on the page.
