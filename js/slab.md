## Brief

The slab.js file includes two functions to render and load complaints on the page, as well as event listeners for form submission and chevron click.
The renderComplaints() function renders the list of complaints on the page, while loadbadReviews() loads existing complaint data from local storage.
The event listeners handle submission of the form and expanding the slab when the chevron is clicked.
