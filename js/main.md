# main.js

## Functions

- `renderChart()`: Render a line chart to display bad reviews over time.
- `main()`: Main function to run on page load, rendering the chart and complaints.

## Brief

The main.js file includes two functions to render a line chart and complaints on the webpage.
The `renderChart()` function generates a line chart showing the frequency of bad reviews over time.
The `main()` function calls `renderChart()`, updates the slab height, and renders the complaints on the webpage.
