            <h2>The Epic of Nanni</h2>
            <p>Long before the time of kings and emperors, in the land of Sumer, there lived a merchant named Nanni.</p>
            <p>
              One day, Nanni decided to send a message to Ea-nasir, a copper merchant who had sold him some low-quality
              copper:
            </p>
            <blockquote>
              <p>
                "When you came, you said to me as follows : 'I will give Gimil-Sin (when he comes) fine quality copper
                ingots.' You left then but you did not do what you promised me. You put ingots which were not good
                before my messenger (Sit-Sin) and said: 'If you want to take them, take them; if you do not want to take
                them, go away!'"
              </p>
            </blockquote>

            <h3>Ea-Nasir's greed</h3>
            <p>
              After receiving Nanni's letter, Ea-nasir sent a response that was anything but satisfactory. He insulted
              Nanni and claimed that the copper was of the highest quality.
            </p>
            <p>
              In response, Nanni wrote another letter, which is famous for its colorful language and memorable insults.
            </p>
            <p>
              He accused Ea-nasir of being a cheat and a liar and threatened to take his case to the king. Nanni also
              warned Ea-nasir that he would spread the word about his dishonesty, saying:
            </p>
            <blockquote>
              <p>"You will know what kind of person I am, when I send my messenger to collect the good money."</p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>The letter ends with Nanni telling Ea-nasir that he will never do business with him again.</p>
            <p>Despite Nanni's threats, it is not clear what happened next.</p>
            <p>
              We don't know if he was able to collect his money or take his case to the king. Ea-nasir might have
              ignored him, or made a reply now lost in time.
            </p>
            <p>
              Nanni likely didn't know his complaint would be made immortal, but at brF we think it would please him to
              get a last laugh that echoes for all eternity.

            <h4>Nanni's legend lives on</h4>
            <p>
              We have ancient texts that feature kings, priests, and other elites, but few on the challenges faced by
              merchants and ordinary people.
            </p>
            <p>
              Nanni's letters give us a rare 4,000+ year glimpse into the world of ancient Sumerian commerce, and stand
              as a testament to timeless power of a well-worded complaint.
            </p>
            <p>
              At 'Bad Reviews FOREVER', we believe everybody deserves the chance to immortalise their unresolved
              complaints.
            </p>
            <p>
              Clay tablet-preserving ruins are hard to find. We'll etch our complaints in copper, which is just as
              central to the story but won't melt when it rains.
            </p>
            <p>
              Owing to Nanni's warning, we won't be buying our copper from Ea-nasir. We'll find a supplier who won't
              treat us so poorly we set our ire in stone.
            </p>
            <p>
              We hope our new tablet will serve as a reminder to treat you customers with respect and fairness, just as
              Nanni's did so many years ago.

          <h2>British Museum Forever?</h2>
          <p>
            We believe that everyone deserves to have their complaints heard and that's why we're creating a copper
            tablet inspired by Nanni's legendary clay tablet. But we don't want to stop there.
          </p>
          <p>
            Once we receive 100 complaints, we'll hand select some for etching into a real copper tablet to be offered
            to the British Museum.
          </p>
          <p>
            Think of it like a modern-day time capsule, a way for people in the future to see that bad service has been
            a problem throughout history.
          </p>
          <p>We'll make our way to the museum unannounced and try to convince them to display our tablet.</p>
          <p>
            Who knows? Maybe it'll be the first time the British Museum will feature complaints alongside their
            artifacts.
          </p>
          <p>With your help, we can make it happen.</p>
          <p>
            Thanks to Nanni, we have a lasting record of his complaint. But if you want your complaint to be heard and
            remembered, sign up today and make it indelible.
