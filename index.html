          <h2>The Epic of Nanni</h2>
          <p>
            Long before the time of zero-star reviews, in the land of Sumer, there lived a merchant named Nanni
            <br />
            One day, Nanni decided to send a message to Ea-nasir, a copper merchant who had sold him some low-quality
            copper:
          </p>
          <blockquote>
            When you came, you said to me as follows :
            <br />
            <q> 'I will give Gimil-Sin (when he comes) fine quality copper ingots.' </q>
            <br />
            You left then but you did not do what you promised me.
            <br />
            You put ingots which were not good before my messenger (Sit-Sin) and said:
            <br />
            <q>' If you want to take them, take them; if you do not want to take them, go away!' </q>
          </blockquote>
          <p>
            After receiving Nanni's letter, Ea-nasir sent a response that was anything but satisfactory. He insulted
            Nanni and claimed that the copper was of the highest quality.
            <br />
            In response, Nanni wrote another letter, which is famous for its colorful language and memorable insults.
            <br />
            He accused Ea-nasir of being a cheat and a liar and threatened to take his case to the king. Nanni also
            warned Ea-nasir that he would spread the word about his dishonesty, saying:
          </p>
          <blockquote>
            You will know what kind of person I am, when I send my messenger to collect the good money.
          </blockquote>
          <p>The letter ends with Nanni telling Ea-nasir that he will never do business with him again.</p>

          <h3>Ea-Nasir's greed</h3>
          <p>Despite Nanni's threats, it is not clear what happened next.</p>
          <p>
            We don't know if he was able to collect his money or take his case to the king. Ea-nasir might have ignored
            him, or made a reply now lost in time.
            <br />
            Nanni likely didn't know his complaint would be made immortal, but at brF we think it would please him to
            get a last laugh that echoes for all eternity.
          </p>
          <p>
            We have ancient texts that feature kings, priests, and other elites, but few on the challenges faced by
            merchants and ordinary people.
            <br />
            Nanni's letters give us a rare 4,000+ year glimpse into the world of ancient Sumerian commerce, and stand as
            a testament to timeless power of a well-worded complaint.

          <h4>Nanni's legend lives on</h4>
          <p>
            At 'Bad Reviews FOREVER', we believe everybody deserves the chance to immortalise their unresolved
            complaints.
          </p>
          <p>We are going to prooduce our own tablet, and everyone is invited to feature on it!</p>
          <p>
            Clay tablet-preserving ruins are hard to find, So we'll etch our complaints in copper, which is just as
            central to the story, but won't melt when in the Britsh rain.
            <br />
            Owing to Nanni's warning, we won't be buying our copper from Ea-nasir. We'll find a supplier who won't treat
            us so poorly we set our ire in stone.
            <br />
            We hope our new tablet will serve as a reminder to treat you customers with respect and fairness, just as
            Nanni's did so many years ago.
          </p>

          <h2>British Museum Forever?</h2>
          <p>
            We believe that everyone deserves to have their complaints heard and that's why we're creating a copper
            tablet inspired by Nanni's legendary clay tablet. But we don't want to stop there.
          </p>
          <p>
            Once we receive 100 complaints, we'll hand select some for etching into a real copper tablet to be offered
            to the British Museum.
          </p>
          <p>
            Think of it like a modern-day time capsule, a way for people in the future to see that bad service has been
            a problem throughout history.
          </p>
          <p>We'll make our way to the museum unannounced and try to convince them to display our tablet.</p>
          <p>
            Who knows? Maybe it'll be the first time the British Museum will feature complaints alongside their
            artifacts.
          </p>
          <p>With your help, we can make it happen.</p>
          <p>
            Thanks to Nanni, we have a lasting record of his complaint. But if you want your complaint to be heard and
            remembered, sign up today and make it indelible.
