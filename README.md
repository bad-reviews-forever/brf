# Bad Reviews FOREVER - A Design Outline

## Introduction:

Bad Reviews FOREVER (brF) is a website that aims to immortalize bad reviews in a creative and engaging way. The website uses a thematic approach to encourage users to submit their complaints and grievances, which are then displayed on a virtual engraved copper slab. This design outline presents the technical details of the website to a contracted web developer.

## Design Elements:

### Header:

The website's header is a full-width section that contains the site's title, "Bad Reviews FOREVER," styled using CSS to look like cuneiform engraved in aged copper.

### Main Content:

The main content of the website consists of multiple absolute positioned block subsections of marginally different background color that the user can scroll through. Each section captures the scroll wheel to scroll its own content, if required. The first main content section is a short story presented in a "drunk history" style, which introduces the concept of an indelible bad review. The story is favourable to the displeased customer named "Nanni" and encourages the user to record their own bad reviews.

The second main content section is a web form that allows users to record their bad review via a simple, but thematic web form. The form contains six text entry areas, one checkbox, and one submit button. The form submission is followed by a chart.js chart that combines the user's submitted data with data kept in local storage. The chart shows an area graph with the y-axis tracking the number of bad reviews and the x-axis showing bad reviews over time.

The final main content section describes in detail the plot to have a modern slab of indelible complaints displayed at the British museum alongside Nanni's. This section includes a timeline with gradually thickening line that frames the bullet points for the events within the timeline, and ends with an arrowhead pointing to the result of the new tablet being displayed.

### Footer:

The website's footer is a full-width splash that contains boilerplate acknowledgments and copyright notices, as well as links to the developer's GitHub and social media.

### Features:

The website uses a creative approach to encourage users to submit their bad reviews in a thematic and engaging way. The website includes a virtual engraved copper slab, which displays the user's bad review in a visually appealing format. The website also includes a web form that allows users to submit their bad reviews, which are then displayed on the virtual slab. The website uses chart.js to create an area graph that tracks the number of bad reviews over time. The website also includes a timeline that outlines the plot to have a modern slab of indelible complaints displayed at the British museum.

## Conclusion:

Bad Reviews FOREVER is a unique website that encourages users to submit their bad reviews in a creative and engaging way. The website uses a thematic approach to make the process of submitting a bad review more enjoyable and visually appealing.
